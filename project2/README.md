## How tu run our code
You can obtain our result on kaggle by running the program run.py 
which will execute ALS on the data with the best hyperparameters we found
with the cross-validation. The predictions will be in the file prediction.csv

## KNN version
You can run the KNN version by calling KNN_surprise which will create a prediction in the file which filename is given as parameter

## SVD version
Call the SVD_surprise function to run the SVD algorithm and create a submission in the same fashion as the KNN version
